Introduction
=============================================================================

"ISD SMB Util" is based on "SMB Utilty English Beta 3" by M.K.S as well as the Item SMB2 Japanese which is the Japanese version of SMB Utility Version 1.04. It is added with a few corrections that is miscorrected. It is also added many item SMB2 Japanese Item names inside ISD SMB Util. M.K.S only knows these things; He do not know my own details. So you cannot, I repeat, CANNOT ask M.K.S about "ISD SMB Util".

Please note that I have no knowledge in programming. Someone else only taught me to do it.

=============================================================================
Why did I design this?
=============================================================================

I didn't design it. I modified it. It can motivate ROM-Hackers to hack SMB1 with SMB2 Japanese Items. The tool called Item SMB2 Japanese is created by SMB Software based on SMB Utility Version 1.04 which is the Japanese version. You can find Item SMB2J on my website or SMB Software's webpage or grab SMB Utility Version 1.04 on my website as well. So I motivate myself to do the English version of Item SMB2J called ISD SMB Util based on SMB Utility Version 1.00 English BETA 3. That's because too many fellow Americans cannot understand the native Japanese langauge. And of course I took my own name in my own level editor for it.

What comes with it other than ISD SMB Util?
=============================================================================

This package comes with SMB Mapper 1 as well as the batch file called Mapper. You can follow instructions in SMB Mapper1.txt It also has Lunar IPS (Patcher), Translhextion (Hex Editor), a few IPS Patches, SMB1 Fix, SMB2 Japanese levels and SMB2 Japanese documents.

=============================================================================
What's added in ISD SMB Util?
=============================================================================

ADDED:
Name all items to SMB2 Japanese based
About file (But believe me, I do not claim SMB Utility as my own)

CORRECTED:
Unedited Japanese Text in Sort Areas to Room of Area when choosing an area.
Brick (Tree of beans) replaced with Brick (Vine).
A few Captializations.
Brick: Surface which has pitholes and celing has been changed to Brick: Celing.
The word Cancle has been corrected to Cancel when exiting SMB Utility.
In the text editor dialogue. Mario (Unknows blah, blah, blah) is changed to Mario (Unknown)
The 2nd Night and Snow is changed to Castle Palette.
Reflesh world data changed to Refresh world data.
Righht corrected to Right in the Keyboard configuation.

Stuff still existed that cannot be fixed:
Enable Pilania Plants from 1-1 text dialogue cannot be found.
Custum that should have be Custom which cannot be found as well.

=============================================================================
What is ISD SMB Util used for?
=============================================================================

That's for all ROM-Hackers who hack SMB1 to hack SMB1 with SMB2 Japanese Items. It also have the benefit to hack the FDS SMB2 Japanese version of the game. Please look in SMB2 (J) Levels folder. Keep in mind that the SMB2 Japanese game for the FDS isn't compatable with SMB Utility or ISD SMB Util. For every hack you do with ISD SMB Util, give-me credit for the SMB2 Japanese names.

=============================================================================
Hacking SMB2 Japanese
=============================================================================

There's some stuff in the Smb2 (J) levels and Smb2 (J) docs folder which allows to hack the ACTUAL version of SMB2 Japanese for FDS than SMB1. These 5 patches in the Smb2 (J) levels folder will allow to view every Smb2 (J) level in your SMB1 ROM will allow to edit and paste them in your FDS ROM. You will need the hex editor to dump and insert levels from your SMB1 NES ROM into your SMB2J FDS ROM. Please read all tutorials by all means. 

If you don't want to hack the SMB2 Japanese game. Then hack SMB1 with SMB2 Japanese items. It's quite useful.

SMB Utility FAQ
=============================================================================

Q: What is SMB Utility?

A: SMB Utility is a SMB1 level editor that has many features, including a built-in emulator for testing.

Q: What is ISD SMB Util?

A: ISD SMB Util is a SMB1 level editor that include SMB2 Japanese item names along with corrections. ISD SMB Util stands for Insectduel's SMB Utility.

Q: How do you use the emulator?

A: One of the features include a built-in emulator.  You can go to Emulator and click on "Title Screen" to start at the title screen, "Start of level" to go to the start of the level currently opened, "Current Page" to start at the current page of the block/sprite you are editing, "Halfway Area" to start at the halfway page if the area has one, or "End" to stop.  Press F5 to save in the emulator, or F7 to load the savestate.  

Q: What are the other features?

A: Listed in "Tools" include "Edit Text", "Edit Looping Castle Loop", "World Data Update", "Sort Areas", "Record Into Demo", "General Setting", "Edit Some Game Stuff", "Options", and "Configuration".

Q: What's "Edit Text"?  How do you use it?

A: "Edit Text" can edit text, hence the name.  The text it can edit includes the Status Bar, the "Thank You" messages, "Game Over", "Welcome to Warp Zone!", the copyright at the title screen, and the 1P/2P Menu.

Q: What's "Edit Looping Castle Loop"?

A: "Edit Looping Castle Loop" edits how the Loop Commands work.  All of the values (which are in hexadecimal) are in "non-straight" columns.  The world row has the values of the worlds each command works in.  Add 1 to these values for the real world number.  The page row are the values that are the page numbers the loop commands are located.  The V pos row are the values of the locations that Mario has to be at in order to pass the commands.  The values are set up as y pos/x pos.  The Offset of map page skip data row has values of the header of each (one) page skip behind a loop command.  To find these headers, double click on the page skip block.  The value with a "H" next to it (i.e., 3FH, 43H, etc.) in the description is the header of the page skip.  I'm not sure what "World 7's loop" is.  I'm guessing that World 7's looping is special.  The two values next to it tells the world number (hex) of this "special loop".  The values should be the same.  However, I don't know what's the World's 7 loop thing.

However, SMB2 Japanese looping is SOMEHOW different, so you better use SMB2 Japanese level map to edit the loops.

Q: What's "World Data Update"?

A: "World Data Update" updates the world order to the one adjusted in the level order in the Level Select window.  I believe it's useful if you have a number of levels in a world that's not 4.  I believe that from that kind of world, if you have a warp zone to the world after that, it would go to a different level not what you wanted.  If that happens, I suggest you use this.

Q: What's "Sort Areas"?

A: "Sort Areas" allows you to switch places of levels and change the room number of the levels.

Q: What's "Record Into Demo"?

A: "Record Into Demo" allows you to record your own demo.  In the demo, you use the emulator to control Mario.  This feature roughly records this.  However, it is not very accurate, and may turn out very different from what you intended.  I believe that this may be due to the fact that what you wanted was too complex, or there wasn't enough space.

However, there's NO way that I find that data in SMB2 Japanese.

Q: What's "General Setting"?

A:  "General Setting" changes how long the game is by worlds.  This doesn't clear any other level data, however.

Q: What's "Edit Some Game Stuff"?

A: "Edit Some Game Stuff" edits other things.  At the "warpzone" tab, you can edit warp zones.  At the "1UP mushroom" tab, you can edit the amount of coins needed on each x-3 level to get a hidden 1UP on the next level.  At the "Bowser" tab, you can edit which world does Bowser start to throw hammers and what Bowser turns into when killed for each world.  At the "world" tab, you can edit which level do the levels start to get harder (shorter lifts, "after 5-3" enemies) and which world has water levels with castle blocks.  At the "other" tab, you can change how many lives you start with, whether Piranha Plants appear on 1-1 or not, TSA (graphic tiles) for the vertical balls that you can climb on, and time limits (400, 300, 200).

However in SMB2 Japanese, the warp zones is somehow seperate. By hex listing order including 0B 0C and 0D.

Q: What's "Options"?

A: "Options" has options for the emulator and editor.  At the emulator tab, you can Enable MMX (not sure what this means) and Disable Pad.  At the editor tab, you can enable a "room protect system", but I don't know what that is.

Q: What's "Configuration"?

A: With "Configuration", you can edit the keyboard commands for the editor.

Q: Any other features?

A: Yes.  You can send objects to another level, edit level headers, and insert GFX from another ROM!

Q: How do I send objects to another level?

A: Right click an object and select Send... or double-click it.  Make sure the object you are sending isn't page-flagged and there are object "entries" in the page Also, if you are sending sprites, make sure the page you send it at doesn't have a page change.

Q: How do I edit level headers?

A: Go to Edit and select Edit Header.  You can change time (if you changed time limits with Edit Some Game Stuff, 400=1st time limit, 300=2nd time limit, 200=3rd time limit), position (V:1=top, area: X= top, but slightly lower than V:1, V:10=on ground, V:4=in the middle, walking=with autowalk), Back, or starting background (first Night and snow is night and snow palette, second Night and snow is the castle palette), palette/island type (Green and tree uses a green palette with green trees, Orange and mushroom uses an orange palette with mushroom islands, Guns uses a green palette with cannons instead of trees/islands, Clouds replaces the ground, block patterns, and horizontal bricks with the clouds in the cloud bonuses), Seanery, or scenery (not a typo, spelt like that in the window), Basic brick (starting block pattern), Attribute, and Halfway page.

Q: How do I insert GFX from another ROM?

A: Go to File and select Load GFX from another ROM.  This doesn't load TSA (tile arrangements of blocks and sprites) from another ROM, however.

Q: Any other features?

A: Besides editing levels and other features listed here, you can edit the hex values of objects.  With this, you can change enemies or page changes into pointers, or vice verca.  However, I don't recommend doing this, especially the former.  This may cause sprites from other levels to be loaded in the level.  I would recommend sending objects from levels instead.

Q: How do I change objects into other objects?

A: With non-sprite/pointer blocks, you can move the block to V pos <12 for some regular objects, 12 for holes, question blocks, pulleys, and bridges, 13 for page skips (which don't work if they are page flagged) , poles, Reverse L pipe, axes, ropes, castle bridges, continuations, stopping continuations, scroll stops including the warp zone scroll stop, and loop commands, 14 for block patterns or background, and 15 for castles, long Reverse L pipes with no pipe opening on top, staircases, ropes, Upside down pipes, and vertical balls.  For enemies, you can change them into page changes by checking Skip Page and type in the number of pages to skip.  For page changes, you can change them into enemies by unchecking Skip Page and selecting an enemy type.

Q: What's YY-ME?

A: It's another level editor before SMB Utility was released.  The differences between the two that instead of sending objects in SMB Utility, you "add" or "remove" objects (but this is actually taking away or giving away objects to the next room/area (not really level).  Also, YY-ME can also load any SMB ROM, while SMB Utility can only open regular 40,976 byte ROMs or trained 41,488 byte ROMs.

Q: Are there other level editors available?

A: Yes, there's one called SMB MapEditor by ZANTETSU, which is available at YY's Japanese site.  However, I think YY-ME and SMB Utility are better.  There's also another one, which some people may have used or heard of, called Mario Improvement, available at YY's Japanese site and Zophar's Domain.  However, it can't edit enemies.  Both work with trained ROMs.  I believe that YY-ME and SMB Utility are very superior compared to these.

Q: Ahh!!  When I finish a level, the next level's number is a weird tile!  Why!?

A: From my experience, the most common reason is that the staircase (width 9; height 8)'s length is not zero.  These staircases' length should always be 0. If it's not zero, this will happen.
 
Q: Is that all?

A: Pretty much. But the Troubleshooting FAQ in the SMB2 (J) docs folder covers glitches and bugs during gameplay.
